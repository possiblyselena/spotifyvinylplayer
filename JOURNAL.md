# June 4th: Visualizing and brainstorming
During the highway call I talked to some people making projects and brainstormed some ideas and I thought of a vinyl spotify display - similar to @Ducc. I got the idea because I was showing off my Molang PCB I made for Solder and my sister said it looked like a vinyl. So, during the meeting I drew up some notes.

I thought it would be cool if the record player functioned similar to an actual one, so I'm thinking of adding motors to move the needle and spin the vinyl. Next I need to research more parts to see the dimentions of my case. 

Current BOM (with no bills)
- LCD Screen
- Servo Motor
- Stepper Motor
- ESP32 perhaps idk yet
- On/off switch
- Custom PCB for the Record player
- Custom PCB for the Disc

# June 4th: Refining Ideas and Starting the PCB
After a bit of a break, I was inspired by @dld Minecraft Jukebox that used NFC tags for the vinyls. Instead of playing songs of them, it would be cool each vinyl was a profile and you can track their listening instead. Now that I have a clear idea of what I wanted, I started my schematic. I spent a lot of my time looking at parts, so I only placed my microcontroller and switches.
