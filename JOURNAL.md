# June 4th: Visualizing and brainstorming
During the highway call I talked to some people making projects and brainstormed some ideas and I thought of a vinyl spotify display - similar to @Ducc. I got the idea because I was showing off my Molang PCB I made for Solder and my sister said it looked like a vinyl. So, during the meeting I drew up some notes.

I thought it would be cool if the record player functioned similar to an actual one, so I'm thinking of adding motors to move the needle and spin the vinyl. Next I need to research more parts to see the dimentions of my case. 

Current BOM (with no bills)
- LCD Screen
- Servo Motor
- Stepper Motor
- ESP32 perhaps idk yet
- On/off switch
- Custom PCB for the Record player
- Custom PCB for the Disc
